The Text Card product for the TIBCO Spotfire environment is an extension used to visualize text data in an efficient and esthetical way, often alongside other data visualizations. 

Project for Software innovation course at [Gothenburg University](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjN8vmW55jtAhVkmIsKHQtEBgIQFjAAegQIBBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkursplaner.gu.se%2Fpdf%2Fkurs%2Fen%2FDIT827&usg=AOvVaw3_5kJeDs3_ov4auh2zQxuZ) and [TIBCO Spotfire](https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfire)

## Getting started
Visit the project's [website](https://hajke-gu.github.io/text-mod/) for a user guide of the Text Card mod.

To run (and modify) the Text Card mod locally, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
These instructions assume that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm) installed.

### How to get started (with development server)
- Open a terminal at the location of the downloaded/cloned Text Card mod repository.
- Run `npm install`. This will install necessary tools. Run this command only the first time you are building the mod and skip this step for any subsequent builds.
- Run `npm run server`. This will start a development server.
- Start editing, for example `src/main.js`.
- In Spotfire, follow the steps of creating a new mod and connecting to the development server.
