# Spotfire Integration

The Text Card mod integrates seamless in the TIBCO Spotfire environment. The following videos show how the Text Card mod supports the common functions/features of visualizations and interaction between visualizations: 
Marking, Details visualization and Canvas Styling/Theme adaption.

## Marking
Just as in other Spotfire visualizations, you can mark your content, and have the markings being applied in your other related visualizations.

## Details Visualization
Text Card mod supports details visualizations. Details visualizations can be created out of other visualizations to show Text Cards of a certain sub-dataset. Or, vice versa, details visualization can be created out of a marked sub-dataset within the Text Card mod.
If the Text Card mod does not show up in your list for details visualizations, make sure to pin it to your visualizations.

Like the native spotfire visualizations, the Text Card mod supports and adapts to custom themes/canvas styling.
